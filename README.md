# GuessTheNumber
A game where the user has to guess a randomly generated integer. The program gives hints to the user whether they should go higher or lower. Once the user guesses correctly, they are congratulated and shown how many guesses it took them to reach the correct answer. The game gives the user the choice to play again or to end the program.
